# PeerWebSite
Realtime Peer to Peer Web Site

Function Description: "Use WebTorrent" -> WebTorrent lets you stream videos and have overall performance advantages especially for sites with a lot of files but they download slow, when there are not many seeders and often did not work on other browsers but chrome, as far as I could test it.

Send Text, Picture and Video embedded in HTML and CSS through WebRTC in acquaintance of WebTorrent for files, live edited P2P. No conversation data passes a server nor is saved anywhere but sent directly from browser to browser. Your website disappears from the aether as soon as you close or reload your tab. (maybe one day I will add an option to save, otherwise just copy paste your html, if you need to re-upload your site)

Give me a star on Github and I will consider to actually tide up the code and write Docs for it, that other Developers could have an easy entry to participate, which will bring this App to what you wish for as a peer to peer privacy enthusiast. Also, on the plan is a regional, by km/miles-radius, etc., search engine to opt in your peer web site.

This application has been only tested in Chrome. Don't expect miracles, it's a pure hobby, side project and due to bleeding edge sometimes buggy.

Evtl. Roadmap: Persist Site as a WebTorrent, Connection Stats, Load/Save, Search Engine

PS: You can not only host simple sites but you could write full JavaScript applications, games and host them from your browser.

Big Thanks to Muaz Khan, feross and all others contributed to the dependencies!
